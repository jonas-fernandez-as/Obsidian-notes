Things that all the programming languages have in common
1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness

Thinking 

"**`Outside the box`**."


Occam's Razor is one of the central principles of modern scientific theory. The principle is based on the following definition:

- `The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`


The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.

"A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation."


"Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning."

Decide (`Decision Making`) on the goal defined in detail (`The Goal`) that you really want to achieve from your heart (`Willingness`), and that will make you happy consciously and subconsciously (`The Brain`).



- Talent is a strongly developed skill with high efficiency.
- Skill is the ability to manage or solve something well.
- Passion is an emotional commitment to a particular area.


QUESTIONS  


We can assign two states to a question; thus, we would describe it as a `rough question` or a `precise question`.

- A `rough question` would be, for example, "How can I hack X?"
- A `precise question` would be: "How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"

As we can see from these two examples, this state of precision can greatly affect the result and the answer. Nevertheless, a precise question is still not good. Because `good` or `bad` are irrelevant states, we now know that they do not influence the result or the answer.


A right question is a precise question that allows us to establish the relationships between the components, to understand them, and to take us one step further to the required answer.



- `What are all the methods available to remotely access Windows operating systems?`
